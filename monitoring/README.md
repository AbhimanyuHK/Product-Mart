- **monitoring/cloudwatch_logging.py**: This script sets up logging to AWS CloudWatch. It includes a function to log messages to CloudWatch Logs.
- **monitoring/cloudwatch_metrics.py**: This script sends custom metrics to AWS CloudWatch. It includes a function to put metric data into CloudWatch.
- **monitoring/cloudwatch_alarms.py**: This script creates CloudWatch alarms. It includes a function to create alarms based on specific metrics.
- **monitoring/requirements.txt**: Specifies the dependencies for the monitoring scripts.

### Usage

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Navigate to the `monitoring` directory and install the required dependencies using pip.
     ```bash
     cd monitoring
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Configure AWS Credentials**:
   - Ensure that your AWS credentials are configured. You can use the AWS CLI to configure your credentials:
     ```bash
     aws configure
     ```

3. **Logging to CloudWatch**:
   - Run the `cloudwatch_logging.py` script to log messages to CloudWatch.
     ```bash
     python cloudwatch_logging.py
     ```

4. **Sending Metrics to CloudWatch**:
   - Run the `cloudwatch_metrics.py` script to send custom metrics to CloudWatch.
     ```bash
     python cloudwatch_metrics.py
     ```

5. **Creating CloudWatch Alarms**:
   - Run the `cloudwatch_alarms.py` script to create alarms in CloudWatch.
     ```bash
     python cloudwatch_alarms.py
     ```

This setup will allow you to monitor your ETL processes by logging messages, sending custom metrics, and creating alarms in AWS CloudWatch. You can expand the scripts to include more detailed logging, additional metrics, and complex alarm configurations as needed for your use case.
